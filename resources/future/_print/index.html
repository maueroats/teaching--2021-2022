    <div class="lead">Answers to questions I have been asked about computer science.</div>
	<h2 id="do-i-need-lots-of-math">Do I need lots of math?</h2>
<p>You can be successful in computer science without being good at math,
but it is more challenging.</p>
<p>You should take all of the math classes you can.</p>
<p>Develop an <strong>understanding why</strong> you are doing things in math
class. That understanding of <em>why</em> math works translates directly into thinking
about <em>why</em> a computer is doing the things it is doing.</p>
<p>There is a lot more <strong>problem solving</strong> in a computer science class than
in a many math classes. Solving the same problem over and over to
build a skill happens a lot in math classes. While you are learning
computer science, you have to learn how to solve new problems in every
assignment. The expectation is that you will be able to use the ideas
you learn in new ways.</p>
<p>Practice <strong>planning</strong> what you are going to do before you do it. You can
do this in math class by thinking about what is going to happen in a
problem before you do it. When people fail to solve programming
problems, it is frequently because they are trying to write a program
without a plan.</p>
<p>Computer science takes some different skills than math class. You can
be successful in computer science without being successful in math
class. However, many people find that the same skills help in both
classes. Bad arithmetic or algebra skills? You&rsquo;ll be fine. Find it
hard to learn new concepts, or apply ideas in new ways? CS could be
challenging.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-cs-a-vs-cs-principles">Comparison: CS A vs CS Principles</h2>
<p><strong>What is the difference between the Advanced Placement Computer
Science A (CSA) and Computer Science Principles (CSP)?</strong></p>
<p>CS Principles is a general introduction to computing. In general, you
should take this class if you are not very comfortable with
programming. Harvard&rsquo;s CS50 course (similar to CS Principles) reports
that 50% of their students described themselves as &ldquo;less comfortable&rdquo;
(with computing). You should not take CS Principles if you already
know how to program.</p>
<p>If you have no experience but really want to learn programming, you
should take Intermediate Computer Science (our equivalent of
Northwestern&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/courses/descriptions/111.html">EECS
111</a>). This
class is described as a &ldquo;required core course in the CS curriculum&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Colleges consider these two courses differently:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Harvard counts their equivalent of CS Principles as a <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/spring/faqs/#does-cs50-satisfy-any-college-requirements">distribution
requirement</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Northwestern University gives elective credit for CS Principles, but
may allow CS A to fulfill a required course for a major.</p>

  </figure>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="preparation-for-college-cs">Preparation for College CS</h2>
<p><strong>What is the best preparation for college computer science?</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion, Intermedate CS offers the best preparation for
college. Compare it to Northwestern&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/courses/descriptions/111.html">EECS
111</a>, a &ldquo;required core course in the CS curriculum&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Intermediate CS will give you time to develop your project management
skills.</p>
<ul>
<li>Planning: break a large project into smaller pieces.</li>
<li>Debugging: check that each piece works before assembling the whole.</li>
<li>Creativity: make interesting projects with flexibility for what you
find interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>AP Computer Science A will teach you the technical details of a
programming language (Java), but the AP curriculum focuses more on
technical details than the translation from concept to reality that
many people need to develop. AP computer science could be an
appropriate first course for someone who is interested in learning
more about algorithms, data structures, and CS competitions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Object oriented programming.</li>
<li>Searching and sorting large lists of data.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have been programming on your own and have a <em>well-crafted</em>
larger project, feel free to ask about placement.</p>

<p>This page will help you decide if you should take AP CS A or
Intermediate CS.</p>
<p>If you are taking Intermediate Computer Science and in January 2021 you
can make an animation using <code>cond</code>, you will be prepared. Your end of
the year goals should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>use a <code>struct</code> to make a more complex animation</li>
<li>use a <code>list</code> to work with an unknown number of things</li>
<li>debug code, probably using DrRacket&rsquo;s Stepper and <code>check-expect</code></li>
</ul>
<p>AP Computer Science Principles is not a class that focuses on
programming, you should ask about whether Intermediate CS or AP CS A
would be more appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="self-check-1-january-project">Self-check 1: January Project</h3>
<p>Make a vertical slider controlled by the mouse. Clicking or dragging
on the slider moves a cross bar which also controls the amount of blue
in the background.</p>
<ul>
<li>When the bar is at the bottom, the background is a dark blue (0,0,100)</li>
<li>When the bar is at the top, the background is pure blue (0,0,255)</li>
</ul>
<p>An advanced student would be able to make a slider that changes the
background from &ldquo;light sky blue&rdquo; at the bottom to &ldquo;royal blue&rdquo; at the top.</p>
<p>Demonstrate your animation works with at least two check-expects.</p>
<p>Everybody currently enrolled in Intermediate Computer Science earning
a B or better can complete the January project before the end of semester one.</p>
<h3 id="self-check-2-may-project">Self-check 2: May Project</h3>
<p>Write a function that takes in a list of
points / ordered pairs $(x,y)$ and a single point $(x_0,y_0)$, and
puts out the point in the list that is closest to $(x_0,y_0)$.</p>
<p>Demonstrate that your function works with at least two check-expects.</p>
<p>Everyone in Intermediate Computer Science earning a grade of B or
better should be able to complete the May Project before the end of
semester two.</p>
<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>
<p>If you are not sure what the question is asking, or if you are unable
to verify that your function works, that is a sign that you need more
preparation. That said, feel free to ask clarifying questions, but
please include some statement about your thinking along with the
question. A good question has the form &ldquo;I think this means &hellip;, is
that correct?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there are ambiguous edge cases, you can choose for yourself how to
handle them, no need to ask my preference. Just indicate in a comment
what you chose.</p>

<p>AP Computer Science A is a college level course that teaches the
fundamentals of computer science programming.</p>
<p>In 2021-2022, the course will teach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python (until Thanksgiving)</li>
<li>Java Fundamentals</li>
<li>Data Structures in Java (post-AP)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>There are two phases of the class that most people are interested in:
the introduction in Python and then the main part in Java.</p>
<h3 id="python">Python</h3>
<p>We will learn Python based on Allen Downey&rsquo;s <em>How to Think
Like a Computer Scientist</em>
(<a href="http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/">Online</a>,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Think-Python-Like-Computer-Scientist/dp/1491939362">book</a>).</p>
<p>We will continue to work on project management skills, writing games
like <a href="https://www.mathplayground.com/peg_jumper.html">peg jumper</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_men%27s_morris">nine man&rsquo;s
morris</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four">Connect Four</a>
or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi">Reversi</a>.</p>
<p>These will quickly involve working with lists.</p>
<h3 id="java">Java</h3>
<p>We use a mix of sources. The best online practice site is
<a href="https://codingbat.com/java">CodingBat</a>. We have used Litvin&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.skylit.com/javamethods/index.html">Java
Methods</a> in the past.
During the pandemic year we used <a href="http://www.bluepelicanjava.com/">Blue Pelican
Java</a> - the book can be downloaded
for $0.</p>
<p>Java is a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">blub language</a> designed
for big business use. Languages like Java are everywhere. You will
definitely use them if you continue in computer science. However, it
is not usually considered sleek and elegant.</p>
<h3 id="data-structures">Data Structures</h3>
<p>At the end of the course we will make our own homemade versions of
important data structures like linked lists, trees, and hash
tables. These cartoon versions will give you an intuition how the
&ldquo;real thing&rdquo; works without all of the details.</p>

    <div class="lead">Something to demonstrate that you know how to program.</div>
	<p>If you have already taken Intermediate Computer Science, there is no
need to take a placement test. See the <a href="/teaching--2021-2022/resources/future/ap-prep/">AP Preparation</a> page for the skills you should have acquired.</p>
<p>You should only take AP computer science without Intermediate CS if you have
some significant programming experience.</p>
