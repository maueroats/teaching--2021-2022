<p>Please see the <a href="/teaching--2021-2022/resources/grading-scale/">grading document</a> for
COVID-year grade weights.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The most important information (contact information, grading scale) comes first.
Anything you need that you do not see here, check the following sources:</p>
<ol>
<li>Class web site resources section</li>
<li>Email me and ask: <a href="mailto:amauer-oats@cps.edu">amauer-oats@cps.edu</a></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="contact-information">Contact information</h2>
<p>I read email regularly. Email <a href="mailto:amauer-oats@cps.edu">amauer-oats@cps.edu</a>.
I am willing to call or text with you.
Make sure your student put your phone number on the parent page of the student information form &hellip; or email me.</p>
<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>
<p>I aim to create an equitable challenge for everyone in my class. I want to provide everyone in the class meaningful work experiences at a manageable but challenging intellectual level. I may give the same credit for different actual assignments to accomplish this goal.</p>
<p>The student side of this equitable challenge is that I expect everyone to work on computer science 100% of the time in class. This applies even if someone is finished with the current assignment or has been absent for a week. I have a shelf full of books available for advanced or catch-up work.</p>
<p>I expect everyone to take my suggestions for improving their work seriously. Computer science is an art as well as a science. Polish good habits, eradicate bad ones. Please admit if you cling to unproductive habits and work honestly to change them.</p>

<p>Three tardies more than 5 min late count as one absence.</p>
<p>Any absence with a note <em>from a medical doctor</em> does not count toward the total absences. (Please make sure I see a copy of the note!) All other absences count. Please discuss necessary accomodations for IEP/504 in the first two weeks of class if I am not aware of them.</p>
<h2 id="differentiation">Differentiation</h2>
<p>All assigned work is expected to be completed.</p>
<p>There is no extra credit without regular credit. The way to improve a grade is through consistent effort, seeking help when needed, and allocating enough effective work time outside of class. Please track your work in your interactive notebook so we can discuss how to make your time more effective.</p>
<p>Advanced students may be allowed to replace standard work with projects, but <em>all exceptions will be accompanied by a written contract</em> detailing what other work will be completed to replace the main line coursework. In at most two weeks, the project is due and will receive a grade. Students are still responsible for standard material.</p>
<h2 id="essentials-of-involvement">Essentials of involvement</h2>
<p>As much as we can, we let students manage their own learning. Occasionally parents should be involved more at home. Sometimes adults need to talk directly. Please contact me directly if you see (or are being told) that grades are not up to date or your student is exempt from the work for any reason and does not have written documentation.</p>
<h2 id="daily-materials">Daily Materials</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Notebook: A thin spiral or composition notebook dedicated to computer science is required for planning, reflection, and documenting progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>USB Flash Drive: A small USB drive to store files. (Any size is fine. Code is small.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="iep-and-504-plans-will-be-followed">IEP and 504 plans will be followed</h2>
<p>Any student with a 504 or IEP will receive all accomodations listed. Please make sure the teacher has received a copy of the plan at the start of the year (especially if your schedule has changed, sometimes the paperwork follows too slowly).</p>
<h2 id="state-standards">State standards</h2>
<p>Computer Science Teachers Association standards applicable in this class:</p>
<ul>
<li>4.2.1 Computational Thinking (CT)</li>
<li>4.2.2 Collaboration (CL)</li>
<li>4.2.3 Computing Practice and Programming (CPP)

<h2 id="ap-review">AP Review</h2>
<p>We will do approximately three weeks of AP review before the AP exam. Second semester grades will be significantly impacted by AP test preparation.</p>
<p>Many people benefit from outside preparation. Start in February. As a rough guide, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Barrons-AP-Computer-Science-7th/dp/1438005946">Barron&rsquo;s AP Computer Science A</a> text is too easy and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Prepared-Computer-Science-Exam-Java/dp/0982477538">Be Prepared for the AP Computer Science Exam in Java</a> book by Litvin and Litvin is too difficult. I have not read the Princeton Review text.</p>
<p>In 2016-2019, Whitney Young&rsquo;s AP CS pass rate was been: 93%, 100%,
and 100% so you will be prepared. In 2018 and 2019,
we had 70% and 50% of students earn the highest mark (5) on the
test. Studying matters if you want to achieve the highest mark.</p>

	<p>Being honest and honorable regarding one’s academic integrity is
essential in all of your classes.</p>
<p>Students are expected to adhere to the following honor code regarding
all of their work in this class.</p>
<ul>
<li>“I have neither given nor received improper aid on this test/project.”</li>
</ul>
<p>“Improper aid” includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>copying another student’s work</li>
<li>allowing another student to copy your work</li>
<li>sharing the problems given on a test to a student who has not
taken the test</li>
<li>copying work from any online or electronic resource without citation</li>
<li>chatting or texting with another student during a test in which
computer use is allowed</li>
</ul>
<p>On a project (not test), it is acceptable to give suggestions to a
student who knows less than you do.</p>
<ul>
<li>The student who is giving help may read the code of the student
seeking help.</li>
<li>The student who is giving help may <em>not</em> type (or write) any code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Penalties when a student is caught cheating in this class may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A zero on the assessment</li>
<li>Final grade being lowered a letter</li>
<li>Expulsion from National Honor Society (NHS or NJHS)</li>
<li>Denial of a future application to National Honor Society (NHS or NJHS)</li>

	<p><strong>Wanted</strong>: A snapshot of one of the parts of your career that you
find most interesting, with enough details to make it feel &ldquo;real&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Who?</strong> Anyone whose work involves or <em>could involve</em> automation or
computer assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> Students benefit from a broad idea of possible career paths,
especially careers that are not &ldquo;popular&rdquo; in high school. They need to
hear what a career is like so they begin to consider it a real option.</p>
<p><strong>Breadth of possibilities</strong>:
Anything ranging from tasks that &ldquo;should be&rdquo; automated to things that
are already.</p>
<ul>
<li>Repetitive data analysis (counting bills passed the Illinos House
and Senate)..</li>
<li>Cutting-edge computer simulation of some process.</li>
<li>Custom woodwork that is not automated, explaining why not</li>
<li>CNC mill operator: explain the level of exactness for the work, how
to measure fine tolerances, come demonstrate some of the measurement
tools or bring a small group to the shop. Explain how computer
control has improved the process, and a systematic issue that
remains.</li>
<li>Mechanical engineer in charge of some fickle fabrication process,
with a discussion of how to find the source of the problems.</li>
<li>Structural engineer at UIUC: pictures of failure modes of reinforced
concrete pillar, discuss forces a work, outline lab research program
to detect cracking by some new simulation method.</li>
<li>Software engineer</li>
<li>Computer security - penetration tester.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Include Details?</strong>
Yes! Details make the difference between totally real challenges and
generalities ignored by students.</p>
<p>An interviewer (a student or me) can help flesh out ideas and figure
out a good level of detail to include, and potentially do background
work or presentation preparation for you.</p>

    <div class="lead">Steps to getting your letter written.</div>
	<p>The most important contribution I can make to your application is
concrete evidence of some of the claims you make about yourself. I can
also address things that are not visible in your application (e.g.,
integrity, grit) and things that you cannot bring up yourself (e.g.,
poor grade in another class due to irresponsible teaching).</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell me about something you worked hard at.</li>
<li>What project did you do (in my class) that you are most proud of?
(Any similar accomplishments ok.)</li>
<li>What topics did you find difficult to understand, and what did you
do about it?</li>
<li>Big projects: usually someone I am writing for has completed some
kind of larger project, either in my class or outside. Tell me about
at least one.</li>
<li>How have you grown over the years that I have known you?</li>
<li>What has made you successful?</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important that I give specific examples to back up general
assertion that I make. You are much more likely to remember particular
things that you have done than I am. Please help me remember when you
answer these questions!</p>
<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s not done until you hear from me that it is done. Continue to
talk to me about when it will be done until it is complete. In the
worst case scenario, you can sit in the room and answer questions as
I write it. <strong>Do not assume I will complete the letter with no
interaction from you!</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Letters are generally done at least 24 hours before the
deadline. If that will not be the case, you should have
communication from me.</p>
</li>
<li>

    <div class="lead">My own thoughts on senioritis.</div>
	<p>Senior-itis is an affliction in which seniors no longer feel any
motivation to do work in school. They don&rsquo;t care about what they are
learning, they feel it is pointless, they disengage.</p>
<p>At the root, senioritis is a symptom; years of external motivation are
the cause. External motivation is a form of motivation that comes from
outside - grades, candy, money. Opposite of external motivation is
<em>internal</em> motivation - doing something for the joy of
learning, to live a morally upright life, or because you value the
experiences you will have in the doing.</p>
<h2 id="a-virtuous-cycle">A virtuous cycle</h2>
<p>Students and teachers (ideally) live in a kind symbiotic
relationships. Students trying harder makes teachers want to teach
more. The better a class goes, the more time is spent on preparing for
it - by students and teachers alike. Seniors who give up on learning
break this virtuous cycle, leading to sophomores not trying to
understand what is going on in a class - giving up years before they
are really done with school. Quitting that early means they will be
unprepared for any future classes, since they don&rsquo;t really have half
of the work from their sophomore year.</p>
<h2 id="computer-science-is-art">Computer Science is Art</h2>
<p>(Possibly unrelated to the above.)</p>
<p>After gaining a small amount of technical skill, sometimes people are
tempted to quit improving. When Picasa was a teenager (14 years old),
he could already
<a href="https://www.nga.gov/features/slideshows/picasso-the-early-years.html#slide_2">draw very
well</a>. Imagine
if he had quit, satisfied that his work was better than other kids his
age.</p>
<p>Computer science is an art as much as technical skill. You should
strive to write short, elegant code. Code full of ugly hacks, &ldquo;just
get it done&rdquo; work cannot be used to build something complex. The
burden of all of the code, the inappropriate levels of generality
all mixed together, makes it harder and harder to think about the goal
you intend to reach.</p>
<p>In practice computer programming requires a high level
of abstraction and organizational skills. Work to develop
them. Designing and writing a (kind of simple) game is a good test of
your skills. Try it!</p>

    <div class="lead">Answers to questions I have been asked about computer science.</div>
	<h2 id="do-i-need-lots-of-math">Do I need lots of math?</h2>
<p>You can be successful in computer science without being good at math,
but it is more challenging.</p>
<p>You should take all of the math classes you can.</p>
<p>Develop an <strong>understanding why</strong> you are doing things in math
class. That understanding of <em>why</em> math works translates directly into thinking
about <em>why</em> a computer is doing the things it is doing.</p>
<p>There is a lot more <strong>problem solving</strong> in a computer science class than
in a many math classes. Solving the same problem over and over to
build a skill happens a lot in math classes. While you are learning
computer science, you have to learn how to solve new problems in every
assignment. The expectation is that you will be able to use the ideas
you learn in new ways.</p>
<p>Practice <strong>planning</strong> what you are going to do before you do it. You can
do this in math class by thinking about what is going to happen in a
problem before you do it. When people fail to solve programming
problems, it is frequently because they are trying to write a program
without a plan.</p>
<p>Computer science takes some different skills than math class. You can
be successful in computer science without being successful in math
class. However, many people find that the same skills help in both
classes. Bad arithmetic or algebra skills? You&rsquo;ll be fine. Find it
hard to learn new concepts, or apply ideas in new ways? CS could be
challenging.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-cs-a-vs-cs-principles">Comparison: CS A vs CS Principles</h2>
<p><strong>What is the difference between the Advanced Placement Computer
Science A (CSA) and Computer Science Principles (CSP)?</strong></p>
<p>CS Principles is a general introduction to computing. In general, you
should take this class if you are not very comfortable with
programming. Harvard&rsquo;s CS50 course (similar to CS Principles) reports
that 50% of their students described themselves as &ldquo;less comfortable&rdquo;
(with computing). You should not take CS Principles if you already
know how to program.</p>
<p>If you have no experience but really want to learn programming, you
should take Intermediate Computer Science (our equivalent of
Northwestern&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/courses/descriptions/111.html">EECS
111</a>). This
class is described as a &ldquo;required core course in the CS curriculum&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Colleges consider these two courses differently:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Harvard counts their equivalent of CS Principles as a <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/spring/faqs/#does-cs50-satisfy-any-college-requirements">distribution
requirement</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Northwestern University gives elective credit for CS Principles, but
may allow CS A to fulfill a required course for a major.</p>

  </figure>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="preparation-for-college-cs">Preparation for College CS</h2>
<p><strong>What is the best preparation for college computer science?</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion, Intermedate CS offers the best preparation for
college. Compare it to Northwestern&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/courses/descriptions/111.html">EECS
111</a>, a &ldquo;required core course in the CS curriculum&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Intermediate CS will give you time to develop your project management
skills.</p>
<ul>
<li>Planning: break a large project into smaller pieces.</li>
<li>Debugging: check that each piece works before assembling the whole.</li>
<li>Creativity: make interesting projects with flexibility for what you
find interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>AP Computer Science A will teach you the technical details of a
programming language (Java), but the AP curriculum focuses more on
technical details than the translation from concept to reality that
many people need to develop. AP computer science could be an
appropriate first course for someone who is interested in learning
more about algorithms, data structures, and CS competitions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Object oriented programming.</li>
<li>Searching and sorting large lists of data.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have been programming on your own and have a <em>well-crafted</em>
larger project, feel free to ask about placement.</p>

<p>This page will help you decide if you should take AP CS A or
Intermediate CS.</p>
<p>If you are taking Intermediate Computer Science and in January 2021 you
can make an animation using <code>cond</code>, you will be prepared. Your end of
the year goals should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>use a <code>struct</code> to make a more complex animation</li>
<li>use a <code>list</code> to work with an unknown number of things</li>
<li>debug code, probably using DrRacket&rsquo;s Stepper and <code>check-expect</code></li>
</ul>
<p>AP Computer Science Principles is not a class that focuses on
programming, you should ask about whether Intermediate CS or AP CS A
would be more appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="self-check-1-january-project">Self-check 1: January Project</h3>
<p>Make a vertical slider controlled by the mouse. Clicking or dragging
on the slider moves a cross bar which also controls the amount of blue
in the background.</p>
<ul>
<li>When the bar is at the bottom, the background is a dark blue (0,0,100)</li>
<li>When the bar is at the top, the background is pure blue (0,0,255)</li>
</ul>
<p>An advanced student would be able to make a slider that changes the
background from &ldquo;light sky blue&rdquo; at the bottom to &ldquo;royal blue&rdquo; at the top.</p>
<p>Demonstrate your animation works with at least two check-expects.</p>
<p>Everybody currently enrolled in Intermediate Computer Science earning
a B or better can complete the January project before the end of semester one.</p>
<h3 id="self-check-2-may-project">Self-check 2: May Project</h3>
<p>Write a function that takes in a list of
points / ordered pairs $(x,y)$ and a single point $(x_0,y_0)$, and
puts out the point in the list that is closest to $(x_0,y_0)$.</p>
<p>Demonstrate that your function works with at least two check-expects.</p>
<p>Everyone in Intermediate Computer Science earning a grade of B or
better should be able to complete the May Project before the end of
semester two.</p>
<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>
<p>If you are not sure what the question is asking, or if you are unable
to verify that your function works, that is a sign that you need more
preparation. That said, feel free to ask clarifying questions, but
please include some statement about your thinking along with the
question. A good question has the form &ldquo;I think this means &hellip;, is
that correct?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there are ambiguous edge cases, you can choose for yourself how to
handle them, no need to ask my preference. Just indicate in a comment
what you chose.</p>

<p>AP Computer Science A is a college level course that teaches the
fundamentals of computer science programming.</p>
<p>In 2021-2022, the course will teach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python (until Thanksgiving)</li>
<li>Java Fundamentals</li>
<li>Data Structures in Java (post-AP)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>There are two phases of the class that most people are interested in:
the introduction in Python and then the main part in Java.</p>
<h3 id="python">Python</h3>
<p>We will learn Python based on Allen Downey&rsquo;s <em>How to Think
Like a Computer Scientist</em>
(<a href="http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/">Online</a>,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Think-Python-Like-Computer-Scientist/dp/1491939362">book</a>).</p>
<p>We will continue to work on project management skills, writing games
like <a href="https://www.mathplayground.com/peg_jumper.html">peg jumper</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_men%27s_morris">nine man&rsquo;s
morris</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four">Connect Four</a>
or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi">Reversi</a>.</p>
<p>These will quickly involve working with lists.</p>
<h3 id="java">Java</h3>
<p>We use a mix of sources. The best online practice site is
<a href="https://codingbat.com/java">CodingBat</a>. We have used Litvin&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.skylit.com/javamethods/index.html">Java
Methods</a> in the past.
During the pandemic year we used <a href="http://www.bluepelicanjava.com/">Blue Pelican
Java</a> - the book can be downloaded
for $0.</p>
<p>Java is a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">blub language</a> designed
for big business use. Languages like Java are everywhere. You will
definitely use them if you continue in computer science. However, it
is not usually considered sleek and elegant.</p>
<h3 id="data-structures">Data Structures</h3>
<p>At the end of the course we will make our own homemade versions of
important data structures like linked lists, trees, and hash
tables. These cartoon versions will give you an intuition how the
&ldquo;real thing&rdquo; works without all of the details.</p>

    <div class="lead">Ideas to inspire you when you feel unsuccessful.</div>
	<p>One common problem at Whitney Young: lots of people here are used to
being good at everything. When you find something you are not
instantly successful at, it is natural to think you are intrinsically
&ldquo;no good at it&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="positive-messages-for-you">Positive messages for you</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your family cares for you no matter what. (Support!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talking is better than hiding. (Even when you feel like you know nothing.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will get into a good fit college even if your senior year does
not feel perfect. College applications can make people feel
bad. I observed a senior denigrate their accomplishments as &ldquo;six
years of slacking.&rdquo; No way, it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Celebrate successes as they come. Little successes are good. They
are the route to big successes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set process goals, not grade goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Study for 60 minutes for the quiz.</li>
<li>Be able to explain the details of two items that should be on
tomorrow&rsquo;s quiz.</li>
<li>Ask a friend to explain one new concept to you. (For those who
are quiet.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-personal-story">A personal story</h2>
<p>My senior year in high school, I joined the choir. Since not enough
guys sang, I got put in the &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; choir. <!-- One time I got roasted
for singing really loudly in a church - it was a beautiful place, I
was excited, and sang really loud. --> The thing I remember most was
having to learn songs in foreign languages, phonetically - memorizing
every sound. Memorization did not come easily to me. I had to sit in
my room for hours going over and over the words to the music. In the
end, I knew the words and other people in the choir knew the notes, so
it worked out. I was proud of that accomplishment.</p>
<p>Look for little successes like that. They will start you on the road
to bigger successes.</p>
